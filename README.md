## Customer Churn Analysis (R)

# Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior using R and R Markdown.
The goal is to identify key drivers of churn and build predictive models to help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

# Project Structure
Customer-Churn-Analysis.html – Interactive HTML report generated from R Markdown

# R Markdown source – Contains code, visualizations, and narrative analysis

# Dataset – Includes customer usage, support, payment, and subscription data

# Key Objectives
Calculate churn rate
Identify primary churn drivers
Build and evaluate predictive churn models
Detect high-risk customer segments

# Techniques Used
Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
Customer Segmentation & Risk Profiling
Key Insights (from report)
Low usage frequency and short customer tenure are strong predictors of churn
High support call volume strongly correlates with churn likelihood
Payment delays and subscription irregularities are major churn indicators

# Tools & Libraries
R, R Markdown, knitr
tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr
caret, rpart, randomForest
pandoc (for HTML rendering)
